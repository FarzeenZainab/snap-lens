Requirements:
- Image Upload: Users can upload images from their local machine.
- Zoom Functionality: Users can zoom in or zoom out on the uploaded image to view details or get an overview.
- Tag Creation: Users can create tags on specific areas of the image using their mouse.
- Visual Highlighting: When the user releases the mouse, the application highlights the tagged area and creates a box on the screen where the user dragged the mouse.

Zoom-in and Zoom-out
1. How to zoom-in the image on button click?
Two ways of zooming in and out the image:
    - Change the width and height of the image (in react we have to update the state of the element)
    - Use Transform:scale()

Zooming in and out using width and height property:
Important notes:
If we use (image.style.width), JS will set it as inline styles which is not a good practice. The second issue with this approch is that we only get the value of the styles that we ourselves sets manually on the element. For example: we dset image.style.width and store the value in a variable. But, if we want to get or store image.style.height we can not do that.The reason is that we never set the height of the element using image.style.height. ele.style.cssProperty only works for inline styles.  We will not be able to access the value of any styles coming from a class, from a stylesheet or element's own style. 

We have to add the zoom factor to the current width and height of the image and we can do it by following method:
- use getComputedStyle(element.property) function
- In react to change the width and height of the element we have to update the state so the DOM is manipulated and we can see the changes
